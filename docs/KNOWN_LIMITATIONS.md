# Known Limitations

None of these are blockers — the dashboard still gives you useful information. They're the rough edges you'll notice if you look hard.

## Skills token counts are partial

The Skills route shows every skill Claude Code invoked, how many times, across how many sessions, and when. The **tokens-per-call** column is populated only for skills whose `SKILL.md` lives under `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/`, or `~/.claude/plugins/`. Skills registered elsewhere (project-local `.claude/skills/`, or invocations that go through the `Task` tool with a skill-shaped `subagent_type`) show invocation counts but leave the token column blank.

It's still a useful view — you can see which skills dominate your session time — just don't expect a complete per-skill token cost. PRs to broaden the catalog scan welcome.

Codex rollout logs do not reliably prove skill invocation, so the dashboard reports no Codex skill counts instead of estimating them.

## Codex prices are unavailable unless explicitly configured

Codex usage is counted from local `last_token_usage` events, but this project does not invent prices for private or unlisted model slugs. The UI marks cost as partial when an observed model has no verified entry in `pricing.json`.

## Cost for Pro / Max / Max-20x users is shown as API-equivalent, not subscription value

The Settings route lets you select your pricing plan, but the Overview cost number is always the API-equivalent (what the same usage would have cost on pay-per-token rates). If you're on Pro you pay a flat $20/month regardless of how much of that API-equivalent number you rack up. We don't do "subscription ROI" math yet — Anthropic doesn't publish per-plan rate limits as public JSON, and faking it would be worse than not doing it.

## Cowork sessions are invisible

If you use Claude's Cowork mode (server-side sessions, not local `claude` CLI), those sessions don't write JSONL to `~/.claude/projects/` and the dashboard can't see them.

## Non-standard model names get tier-fallback pricing

If a transcript references a model ID not in `pricing.json` (e.g. a future snapshot that isn't in our table yet), cost is estimated from the tier substring (`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`) in the name. The UI marks these as `estimated: true`. If the model name contains none of those substrings, cost is reported as null.

## First scan can be slow

The first `python3 cli.py scan` on a heavy user's machine can read tens of MB across hundreds of JSONLs. Subsequent scans are incremental (mtime + byte-offset tracking in the `files` table), so they're fast.

## Running two dashboards against the same DB

Both will fight over the SQLite file and you'll see inconsistent numbers and occasional `database is locked` errors. Only run one at a time. If you want to view the dashboard from a second device, use `HOST=0.0.0.0` on the one running machine and point the second device's browser at it.
